This Prework Study Guide was created to help me prepare for the bootcamp road ahead.  It was also created as a resource to help with foundational programming concepts that I may need to refer back to in the future.

This webpage contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage

To use this Prework Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
